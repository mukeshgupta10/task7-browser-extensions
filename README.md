# Task 7 - Cyber Security Internship

## 🛡 Objective:
Identified and removed suspicious browser extensions to improve browser security.

## 🔍 Steps Followed:
1. Opened Chrome Extension Manager (`chrome://extensions`)
2. Checked each extension’s permissions
3. Investigated access to Google Docs, Drive, and all websites
4. Unchecked Incognito access for untrusted extensions
5. Removed suspicious or unnecessary extensions
6. Restarted the browser

## ❌ Extensions Removed:
- [Extension Name 1] - Too many permissions
- [Extension Name 2] - Unknown source, bad reviews

## ✅ Safe Extensions Kept:
- [Example: Grammarly, Dark Reader]

## 🖼 Screenshots:
- `before.png` (all extensions before cleanup)
- `after.png` (after removal)

## 🎯 Outcome:
Gained hands-on experience in identifying browser-based threats and managing extension safety.
